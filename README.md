Simple Proxy using Node.js that Unblocks all of my current and even future Web Ports

Although you do get 100 GB free on Vercel, my web ports are pretty big themselves, and can be as big as 400mb PER VISIT, so you should only be hosting it for yourself

> [!NOTE]
> This shows the Index of my website, so you have to go through the folders and click on the HTML files within said folders to play the web port of your choice, but once you enter the runner HTML file,
> you can bookmark it to avoid having to repeat that
